# Understanding the API
The REST API provides access to features and functionality (resources) using REST-based web
services. Exchanges between the caller and the platform take place using HTTP and HTTPS
requests and the platform returns XML to the caller in the HTTP response.
## Resources
The following are the top-level entry points for the REST API.
>**Warning** `DtSecurityManager` is not included in the following table because it is strongly
>recommended that you do not use it. Since functions accessed through this entry point cannot
>be fully controlled with REST APIs, avoid using any of the resources under `DtSecurityManager`.
